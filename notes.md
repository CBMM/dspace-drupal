# Goals

## Provide paper upload link from [CBMM](http://cbmm.mit.edu/) to [DSpace](http://dspace.mit.edu/)

## CBMM Dspace atom or rss feed.

# Hints

## CBMM's site is a [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org/) app - implement as a Drupal module

 - Example drupal module: [Mollum](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module?f[2]=im_vid_3:56) ([source](http://cgit.drupalcode.org/mollom/tree/mollom.drupal.inc?id=refs/heads;id2=7.x-2.x))

## DSpace has a [rest api](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC5x/REST+API). But status is [unclear](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/REST+API).

## General (repo schema | library), [SWORD](http://swordapp.org), that DSpace uses/has used.

 - Previous CSAIL group had a script for (packaging|pushing) documents to DSpace. Trying to find example of this.
